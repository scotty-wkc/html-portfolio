<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>  
    As I near my mid 30's I've spent a lot of time reflecting over the last 12 months. Identifying what I want to do differently and
    ultimately how I ensure the longevity of both my life, marrige and future. I've found a love and passion for software which is giving
    me levels of excitment that I've not had in years (or even ever in my professional carrer). Working in recruitment (specifically in 
    technology) I'm finding that the deeper I go into that role, the more I am enjoying it.

    I'm a passionate gamer and enthusiastic sports lover. I love MMORPG's, FPS and RPG's as well as mini games that I can play with my 
    wife. In regards to sports, I'm very into basketball, AFL and football, having played all of those sports for the better half of my 
    life.
